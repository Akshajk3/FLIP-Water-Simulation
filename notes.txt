Recap of Eulerian Fluid Sim:
    - use grid with two types of cells, solid and fluid
    - fluid is stored as velicty field
    - use grid where two components of velocity are stored in different location
    - horizontal locations are sotred at center of vertical face
    - vertical locations are stored at center of horizontal face
    - first add gravity
    - then make the fluid incompressible by making sure the amount of fluid that enters is the same that leaves
    - then utilize advection by moving along velocity feild

Two Phase Simulation:
    - use three types of cells solid, fuld and gas
    - density of water is about 1000x greater than air
    - treat air as nothing
    - the velocity between air cells is undefined which is not the same as zero
    - simulator skips air cells, and do not access velocity between air cells because they are undefined
    - use particles to differentiate between air cells and fluid cells
    - water cells are just the non-solid cells that have particles in them
    - PIC: Particle In Cell method

Overview:
    1. Simulate Particles
    2. Transfer velocities from particles to grid
    3. Make the grid velocities incompressible
    4. Transfer velocities from grid to particles

    * Because the particles are the ones carrying the velocity, the advection step can be skipped
